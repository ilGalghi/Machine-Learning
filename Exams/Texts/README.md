# Machine Learning Exams - Texts & Markdown
This directory contains the original PDF texts and their Markdown conversions optimized for Artificial Intelligence processing.

## Folder Structure

* **`./` (Root)**: Contains the original exam texts in **PDF** format.
* **`./MD`**: Contains the converted **Markdown** files and extracted assets (images/graphs).

## MD

The files in the `MD` folder are generated using **[Marker-pdf](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker)**, a tool designed to convert PDF to Markdown while preserving LaTeX math equations and layout. This makes them perfect for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or studying with AI.
